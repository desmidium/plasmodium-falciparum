In the subchallenge 2, the training set were collected very differently in comparison with the test set.
Especially, training set is *in vivo* transcription data set described in [@doi:10.1126/science.1260403] while test set is *in vitro* transcription data set.
To adjust know batch effects, ComBat algorithm[@doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037] in sva package[doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts034] was applied on the high-throughput transcription data and principal component analysis plots on the raw data and adjusted data were made for checking the performance of adjustment (Fig. {@fig:PACbatch}).
