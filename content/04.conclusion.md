## Conclusion


### Take home
Even with automated machine learning, at the moment, we still need to be clever at preprocessing and integrating the data.

It is surprising to us that there is not a separate holdout set for this challenge.
In an attempt to prevent overfitting, the organizers only released the ranking instead of the absolute score of each team's performance.
However, a team can still assess the trajectory of their performance compared to other teams and tweak their method in that direction.
