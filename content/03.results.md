### Batch effect adjustment
Before batch adjustment, the two datasets are clearly separated in the first two principal component dimensions (Fig. {@fig:PACbatch}A).
After being adjusted for batch effect, this dataset-specific effect is less evident (Fig. {@fig:PACbatch}B).
The amount of variance explained in each component also seems to be more balanced.

The training dataset consists of 1043 in vivo parasite isolates, each with 4952 transcriptomic features, out of which STIR selects 1068.

TPOT cross-validated balanced accuracy...

### Test sample selection
In general, the parasite developmental stages in the training set are smaller than those in the test set (Fig. {@fig:stages}).
